# 🏗️ Frontend vs Backend — Simple Explanation

---

## 🍕 Think of a Pizza Shop 🍕

- **Frontend:** The part you see.
  - The menu.
  - The signboard.
  - The chairs, colors, lights.

- **Backend:** The kitchen.
  - Where pizza is made.
  - Recipes, ovens, staff.

✔️ Customers don’t see the kitchen but enjoy the pizza.

## 🖥️ In a Website:

| Frontend (Client Side)  | Backend (Server Side)    |
|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| What users see          | Behind-the-scenes magic  |
| Website layout          | Databases                |
| Buttons, colors, text   | Authentication (Login)   |
| Images, videos          | Payment processing       |
| HTML, CSS, JavaScript   | Python, Java, Node.js    |

## 🔥 How It Works Together

1. You open **Zomato** (Frontend).
2. Search for pizza.
3. Frontend shows buttons and menus.
4. Backend searches in the database for nearby pizza shops.
5. Backend sends data to Frontend.
6. Frontend displays it to you beautifully.

## 💡 Without Backend:

- Buttons do nothing.
- No login.
- No real data.

## 💡 Without Frontend:

- You can’t see anything, only code or APIs.
