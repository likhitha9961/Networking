## 🚀 What is the Internet?
---

Imagine the internet is like a huge network of roads that connect houses (computers) all over the world.

- Your computer is one house.
- Websites are other houses (like Google’s house, YouTube’s house).

The internet is the set of roads that connects your house to all other houses.

## 🔗 What Happens When You Open a Website Like google.com?

### 🍕 **Pizza Shop Example to Understand**

- You = The customer.
- Browser (Chrome, Firefox) = Your mobile phone to call.
- Google.com = A pizza shop.
- DNS = The phonebook that tells you the phone number of the pizza shop.
- IP Address = The phone number of the shop.
- Internet = The telephone lines connecting you to the shop.
- HTTP/HTTPS Request = Your call and order.
- Web Server = The pizza shop worker who takes your order and sends pizza (the website) to you.

You (Browser) → DNS (Phonebook) → Server (Pizza Shop) → You (Website/Pizza Delivered)

## 🔍 Step 1: DNS Lookup — Finding the Website’s Address

### 🏠 Real-Life Example:

Imagine you want to call **Domino’s Pizza**, but you don’t know their phone number.

- You check the phonebook (DNS) to find it.

In web terms:

- You type `google.com`.
- The browser asks DNS — “What is the IP address of google.com?”

### 🔗 How DNS Works:

1. **Browser Cache:** Has the number? → Use it.
2. **Computer Cache:** Knows it? → Use it.
3. **Router Cache:** Knows it? → Use it.
4. **ISP DNS Resolver:** Asks the internet if no one knows.

The Resolver does this:

→ Ask **Root Server:** “Who handles .com websites?”  
→ Root replies: “Ask TLD Server (.com).”  
→ TLD replies: “Ask Authoritative Server for google.com.”  
→ Authoritative Server replies with the IP: `142.250.68.206`

✔️ Now your browser knows where to go.

## 🚀 Step 2: Sending a Request

Your browser sends a message to Google’s server:
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: google.com


This message says:

“Hello Google! Please send me your homepage.”

---

## 📦 Step 3: The Server Sends a Response

Google’s server replies:

“Here is your website!”

It sends files like:

- **HTML:** The structure (like walls of a house).
- **CSS:** The design (like paint, colors, furniture).
- **JavaScript:** The behavior (like doors opening, buttons clicking).
- **Images, Videos, Fonts:** Decorations.

---

## 🎨 Step 4: Browser Builds and Shows the Website

- Your browser takes the HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images.
- It puts them together like building a Lego house.
- Shows the final webpage on your screen.

---

## 🔒 HTTP vs HTTPS

- **HTTP:** Like sending letters without an envelope. Anyone can read it.
- **HTTPS:** Like sending letters in a locked box. Only the person with the key (the website) can open it. ✔️ Safe!

## 💡 Frontend vs Backend

| Frontend 🖥️            | Backend 🔧            |
|------------------------|-----------------------|
| What you see (buttons, text, colors) | What happens behind (databases, servers) |
| HTML, CSS, JavaScript  | Java, Python, Node.js, Databases |
| Runs in your browser   | Runs on the server    |

## 🍕 Simple Request-Response Example (Pizza Shop)

| Real Life                 | Web                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| You call Domino's         | Browser sends Request  |
| "I want pizza"            | "I want google.com"    |
| Domino's prepares pizza   | Server prepares website|
| Pizza is delivered        | Website is displayed   |

## 🔥 Some Important Words (Super Simple)

- **IP Address:** The number of the website (like a phone number).
- **DNS:** The phonebook that gives you the IP.
- **Port:** A door on the house. HTTP uses port 80, HTTPS uses port 443.
- **Protocol:** The set of rules (HTTP or HTTPS) used for talking.
- **Client:** Your browser/computer (the one who asks).
- **Server:** The website’s computer (the one who answers).
- **Request:** The question or order.
- **Response:** The answer.

## 🔥 Full Web Journey Flow
You type google.com → Browser asks DNS for IP → Gets IP (e.g. 142.250.68.206)
→ Browser sends HTTP/HTTPS request to server → Server sends website files (HTML, CSS, JS)
→ Browser builds the page → Website appears!

## ✅ Conclusion

This is how the web works in simple steps. Every time you open any website, this full process happens in the background — usually in **less than 1 second**!

Understanding this is the first step to becoming a full stack developer.
